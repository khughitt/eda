title: eda - Exploratory Data Analysis for R

=====================================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/khughitt/eda.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/khughitt/eda)

**Note Feb 26, 2018**: This library is currently in the early stages of development
and is likely to change significantly over time. Feedback and suggestions are
welcome!

Overview
--------

`eda` is a package containing helper classes to assist with exploratory data 
analysis. Object instances are constructed from one or more datasets, including 
optional row and column metadata, and methods are provided for computing useful
summary statistics and visualizations. The overall focus of the package is on
simplicity, with the aim of allowing users to quickly get a feel for a new 
dataset with as few lines of code as possible. As such, some assumptions are
made about the types of visualizations to be made, and customization of plots
is limited compared to those created by hand.

In order to support as wide a range of datasets as possible, a class hierarchy has been created,
including both generic data classes like `EDAMultiMatrix`, as well as domain-specific classes such
as `BioEDA`.  Users also have the ability to inherit from any of the provided classes (which
are built on top of the [R6 class framework](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/R6/vignettes/Introduction.html))
in order to construct new domain-specific classes.

Installation
------------

The easiest way to install `eda` is using the `install_github()` function from
devtools:

```r
devtools::install_github('khughitt/eda')
```

Usage Example
-------------

```{r}
library('eda')
data(diamonds, package='ggplot2')

dat <- EDAMatrix$new(diamonds)
```
